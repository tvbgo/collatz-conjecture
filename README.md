## This is just a simple demonstration of the Collatz Conjecture, also known as 3x + 1.

[For more details on the concept involved](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjectura_de_Collatz)

# Setup

Just clone this repo, go to your terminal and in this folder, execute:
`ruby 3x_plus_one.rb`

The terminal will prompt you to insert a number, the number can be a float or integer

The algorithm will then loop until reaching 1, printing the steps and values along the way
and the total steps taken to reach 1. 

Examples:
